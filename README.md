\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
In dark matter direct detection experiments, it is calibration signals from the detector to sources which produce low-energy neutron recoils that build a bridge between super-sensitive detectors and capture of possible dark matter. Scintillation response can be used to derive the deposited energy on an event-by-event basis, with both type of interaction in the detector and recoil energy as contributing factors. 4-Helium is a good material for neutron recoil, and successful neutron recoil calibration requires an understanding of the particle source as well as the activities inside it, which can be obtained by a combination of experiment data with Monte Carlo simulations.
\paragraph{}
The goal of this project is to use GEANT package to set up simulations with similar geometry shown in the figure and well understood scattering behaviour in 4-Helium for Janis fridge in B255. As is suggested by the requirement of Physics 199, write-up or presentations will be given as reports of the progress.
